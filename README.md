Credits to @RectangularObject 
Or https://github.com/RectangularObject
Who created that code

Also link to original: https://github.com/RectangularObject/UniversalHBE/releases/download/v1.0.2/main.lua


I didn't try copy/rob the original

I use it to loadstring the code:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amachono/UniversalHBE/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
